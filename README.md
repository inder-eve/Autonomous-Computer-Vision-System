# Autonomous-Computer-Vision-System
Complete computer vision work for Aerothon 2025: includes my custom YOLOv8 Bike &amp; Bicycle detection model trained on Kaggle using Roboflow preprocessing, and the final integration of all Autonomous Team models into a unified multi-object detection pipeline. This was used in the drone’s autonomous mission for object detection and navigation.
